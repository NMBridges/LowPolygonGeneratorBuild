# LowPolygonGeneratorBuild
 email nolanmbridges@gmail.com for access to the source code

System Specification Requirements:

- NVIDIA CUDA-capable GPU
- A decent amount of memory (6+ GB is probably good)
- Windows 64-bit operating system
- 8-thread CPU (minimum)

Instructions:

- Open project folder in Powershell or Command Prompt
- Type ".\LowPolyGenerator.exe image" with "image" being replaced with any image in the /assets subfolder (i.e. "eyeball.jpg")
- The resulting low-polygon style image should render. The full resolution version will be in the /outputs subfolder

Obviously, for compatibility reasons this would best function as a website hosted on a dedicated server with the necessary system specifications. The process of transferring it over is currently in the works, and I apologize for any inconvenience.
